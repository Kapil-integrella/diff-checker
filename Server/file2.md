## New Line Added 

### PREV - Provisional Revenue
This is the total year of revenue that we should have secured that month from all in flight engagements that we have a signed statement of work (SOW) against based only on the payment schedules in those SOWs.

### RECREV - Recognised Revenue
This is the amount of revenue we want to recognise that month. The rules that define what is recognised and what is not are complex (e.g the invoicing timing effect) and will usually result in the RECREV being different to the PREV for that month. Can this be drawn from a system rather than spreadsheets? This can only be drawn post the 10 day period over which journalling adjustments are made.

### OPEX - Operating Costs
These are our yearly fixed costs and include permanent employee salaries, pension contributions, office costs, equipment, licence costs, post, remote resource costs. These can vary month to month based on specific charges landing in month.

### COS - Costs of Sale
These are our variable costs per month and include the costs to us of paying contractors, Neal’s costs, Karen’s costs, Graham’s costs

### PRFT - Profit
This is the result of PREV-(OPEX+COS) for that month

### RP - Recognised Profit
This is the result of RECREV-(OPEX+COS) for that month

### PIPE - Pipeline
This is the total value of opportunities that have not been signed, weighted by the likelihood of winning it. Each month a particular potential opportunity might become less likely and therefore it’s value should decrease

### WIP - Work in progress
This is where we have a PO but have not recognised the income, either because we have not invoiced or have not completed the work
